# Task #1
# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

# The = is a simple assignment operator. It assigns values from right side operands to the left side operand.
# While on the other hand == checks if the values of two operands are equal or not.
# If yes, the condition becomes true and it returns a non zero value.

a = 4
b = 3

print( a == b )


# What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

# ** used to get a to the power b
print( a ** b)

# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
# it is a bitwise XOR operator - bitwise XOR (^)
# Each bit position in the result is the logical XOR of the bits in the corresponding position of the operands.
# 1 if the bits in the operands are different, 0 if theyâ€™re equal.

print( a ^ b )
